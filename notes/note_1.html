Availability Zone
</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
An Availability Zone is a single data center or a group of data centers within a Region.
<br/>
Availability Zones are located tens of miles apart from each other. This is close enough to have
<br/>
low latency (the time between when content requested and received) between Availability Zones.
<br/>
However, if a disaster occurs in one part of the Region, they are distant enough to reduce the
<br/>
chance that multiple Availability Zones are affected.
